# 3-6-5_gladiator

Console View
Implement the ConsoleView class to be used as the view module for the Colosseum.

The ConsoleView class implements the Viewable interface.

The '@display()' method prints out a string to the terminal.

The @getNumberBetween() method uses the standard terminal input and loops until an acceptable (that is, within the given inclusive bounds) input is provided by the user.


Gladiators
Create a base class for all gladiator types, and four subclasses, Swordsman, Archer, Assassin, and Brutal.

There is a Gladiator abstract class that provides all necessary functionalities for all its subclasses.

The getFullName method returns the full name of the gladiator assembled from his type and name (such as "Brutal Brutus", "Archer Leo").

The level of a gladiator can be incremented by invoking the levelUp() method. The level can be accessed using the getLevel method.

There is a StatisticMultiplier enum type, which has three values, Low, Medium, and High.

The values of the StatisticMultiplier enum type are the following. Easy - 0.75, Medium - 1.0, High - 1.25

Within the Gladiator class, there are three protected functions that return multipliers for the HP, SP, and DEX statistics, respectively. The functions MUST be implemented by every subclass of Gladiator.

Within the Gladiator class, there are three public functions that return the maximum available values of the gladiator's statistics (HP, SP, and DEX, respectively). The available value is calculated by the maximumStatistic = baseStatistic × statisticMultiplier × level formula.

Every gladiator has a current health value. This decreases during a combat when receiving hits from the enemy. When the value goes below zero, the gladiator dies.

There is a Swordsman subclass of Gladiator. Its multipliers are: HP: medium, SP: medium, DEX: medium

There is an Archer subclass of Gladiator. Its multipliers are: HP: medium, SP: medium, DEX: high.

There is an Assassin subclass of Gladiator. Its multipliers are: HP: low, SP: high, DEX: high.

There is a Brutal subclass of Gladiator. Its multipliers are: HP: high, SP: high, DEX: low.


Gladiator factory
Implement the GladiatorFactory class for creating Gladiator instances.

The @generateRandomGladiator() method randomly generates a new instance for one of the implemented subclasses of Gladiator. The Swordsman subclass is twice as likely to be created than any other subclass.

HP, SP and DEX base statistics are assigned to a random value from range [25-100], and LVL is assigned to a random value from range [1-5].

Only one static Random object is used for randomization throughout the whole project.

Combat simulation
Implement the Combat class for simulating duels between gladiators. The fighting mechanic is the same for all Gladiator subclasses. The combat simulation is turn-based (A attacks B, then B attacks A, and so on).

The Gladiator class provides methods to be used in battle simulation: decreaseHpBy(), isDead(), healUp(), getHp(), getSp(), getDex(), getCurrentHp().

The @simulate() method runs the simulation of the whole fight. If the current health of any gladiator becomes non-positive (<= 0) after an attack, combat is finished, and the attacker is returned as the winner.

If one of the opponents is null, the winner is the one that is not null. If both of the opponents are null, the return value is null.

The first attacker is selected randomly, then the two gladiators take turns.

During each turn, the attacker can either hit the enemy or miss. The chance of hitting is calculated by the following method.

Take the dexterity difference: attackerDex - defenderDex and clamp it (force it into the range [10-100]). For example:

attackerDex = 10;
defenderDex = 120;

attackerDex - defenderDex = -110;
after clamping the value is 10
The clamped value is the percentage chance of the attacker hitting the enemy.

If the attacker hits the enemy, the damage is subtracted from the current health of the enemy. The damage is calculated by the integer value of the following formula:

damage = attackerSp × R
where R is a random number from range [0.1-0.5]

The Combat class saves logs in a List that can be accessed using the @getCombatLog() method.

If the attacker hits the enemy, the following log is persisted. "X deals D damage", where X is the attacker's name and D is the damage.

If the attacker misses, the following log is persisted. "X missed", where X is the attacker's name.

At the end of the combat, the following log is persisted. "X has died, Y wins!", where X and Y are the losing and winning gladiator's names, respectively.

Only one static Random object is used for randomization throughout the whole project.


Tournament
Implement a Tournament class to be used for arranging and invoking combats in the Colosseum. The Tournament class holds the pair of contestants that fight in it. If there are many pairs, they are pushed down on the following tree-like structure, effectively expanding it, similar to the following example.

    Julius
        |----____
    Petros      |
                |-----____
    Remus       |
        |----____
    Linus
This is a Tournament with two pairs of contestants. After their fights are over, the winners make it to next round and fight witch each other. This leads to the identification of the best fighter.

The Tournament can be constructed both with one and multiple values.

The @add() and @addAll() methods are used for adding new Contestants to the Tournament.

The Tournament is balanced, that is, gladiators that make it to the final round have same amount of fights behind them.



Colosseum
Implement the Colosseum class which serves as a main controller for the simulation. It generates participants, builds a Tournament tree out of them, and executes the combats, starting from the lowest level of the tree to get the final champion. During the simulation, the Colosseum class communicates verbosely with the View.

The @generateGladiators() method creates new gladiator instances, using the GladiatorFactory provided in the constructor.

The @splitGladiatorsIntoPairs() method takes a list of gladiators and groups them in pairs that fight during the Tournament.

The @simulateCombat() method executes a combat and logs the events to the View in the following form.

Duel Jupiter versus Nero:
Swordsman Jupiter (371/371 HP, 623 SP, 476 DEX, 7 LVL)
Brutal Nero (790/790 HP, 560 SP, 498 DEX, 8 LVL)

Begin!
- Jupiter missed
- Nero deals 245 damage
- Jupiter missed
- Nero deals 183 damage
  Swordsman Jupiter has died, Brutal Nero wins!
  The winner of each combat has his level increased by one (which then affects his stats), then healed-up back to the available HP.

The @getChampion() method takes a Tournament, simulates a series of combats according to the fight hierarchy starting from the bottom, and returns the final winner as the champion.


Custom attack messages for each Gladiator class
Instead of having "X deals D damage" and X missed" all the time (booooring), implement custom messages for each Gladiator subclass.

Every Gladiator subclass has its own set of custom messages for hitting and missing targets. The messages must contain the original references for the attacker's name and the amount of damage.


Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down
Implement a "Kill or Spare" mechanic that allows loosing gladiators to survive and later fight in another Colosseum. There is no sparing in the second Colosseum.

At the end of each fight, the crowd randomly decides whether the loosing gladiator is spared. The chance of being spared is 25%.

After the end of the original event in the Colosseum, the spared gladiators are put into a new tournament tree and have a second Tournament and a subsequent champion.

There is no sparing in the second Colosseum.

Weapon effects
Implement a weapon effect system that can cause additional damage or other advantages during combat.

When creating a Gladiator, there is a 10% chance that he is granted a special weapon effect. The effect is randomly chosen from the ones mentioned below. The special weapon effects are displayed in the detailed view of the gladiator when announcing the combats.

Bleeding – there is a 5% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy starts bleeding and receives additional damage in each turn (2% of his available HP per turn) until the end of the combat. There can be "multiple bleedings" at the same time with cumulative effects.

Poison – there is a 20% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy gets poisoned and receives additional damage for the next three turns (5% of his available HP per turn). If poisoned again, the receiver immediately dies.

Burning – there is a 15% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy is set on fire and receives additional damage for a random number of turns (in range [1-5]) (5% of his available HP per turn). If set on fire again, the duration of burning is extended by a random amount of turns (in range [1-5]).

Paralyzing – there is a 10% chance that upon receiving a hit, the enemy is paralyzed, which makes him unable to attack or defend himself during the next three turns (effectively, this skips three attacks and deals three hits). If paralyzed again, the duration of the paralyzed state is reset to three turns

Using the weapon effect system you have implemented, create an effect of your own. Will it be freezing, magic, or something else? Be creative!


Hints
1- As you may have noticed, there are a lot of numbers in this project. Don't just put them into your code without explanation. Remember, using "magic numbers" is bad practice!

Manage all randomization through the pre-created static Random object in Utils. In this case, if a "random seed" is provided to the Random constructor, the tournament is exactly reproducible. Check it out!
The Colosseum class is provided with a View and a GladiatorFactory instance. It does not have to worry about either the details or the instantiation of these objects. This pattern is called dependency injection, the best way to decouple parts of our code. You'll hear a lot about this later on.
The hardest part of this project is to build up the Tournament tree and the "execution" of combats. The Tournament itself is a recursive structure, and both processes require a recursive approach. The following example use cases may make this easier to understand.
When a Tournament is created with just one pair of contestants, leave leftBranch and rightBranch uninitialized.
When the second pair is added, divide the Tournament in two branches. The old value (first pair) becomes the value of the leftBranch, and the new pair becomes the value of rightBranch. At this point, we have three instances of the Tournament, the first one, and its two branches. Finally, assign null as the value of the first Tournament. Later on, this is swapped for the winners of subbranches.
When more contestants are added, our job is to add them on each side evenly, to keep the Tournament balanced. We do it simply by calling the add() method on the leftBranch and the rightBranch alternately.
